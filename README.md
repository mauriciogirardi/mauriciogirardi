### Hello ðŸ‘‹


#### About me

I work for 8 years in the port area as a machine operator, in 2017 I decided I wanted to change careers 
and chose the IT area because I always liked to mess with computers, I started to be interested in web 
development and system, so I deepened my studies in Html, Css and javascript and Jquery at the time 
facilitated development, with the knowledge provided created private projects and even freelance work 
creating static freelance pages ,in early 2019 I started a bachelor's degree in software engineering and 
participated in bootcamps and online courses, I am currently on the front end with the technologies 
Html,Css,Javascript,Reactjs,Cypress, currently started studies in Typescrip, React Native and Nodejs, 
Love working on the front end put each pixel in its place and see the screen coming to life, I am a 
person who like to be learning new technologies and framework and I hope to become an excellent full stack 
one day more this does not mean that I will stop loving the front end will only become a complete and better 
professional.
